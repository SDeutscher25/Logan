            <ol>
                <li class="bod">
                    Put the potatoes in a large saucepan; cover with cold water and season with 1 teaspoon salt. Bring
                    to a simmer and cook until tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Add the
                    vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon salt; toss. Let cool slightly, about 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li class="bod">
                    Meanwhile, put the eggs in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, then remove
                    from the heat and let sit, covered, 10 minutes. Drain the eggs and cover with ice water to cool;
                    peel, chop and set aside.
                </li>
                <li class="bod">
                    Whisk the mayonnaise, sour cream, pickle brine, mustard and sugar in a small bowl. Stir in the
                    pickles, celery, scallions and parsley. Spoon the mayonnaise mixture over the potatoes and mix well.
                    Season with salt and pepper. Add the hard-boiled eggs and gently stir to combine. Cover and
                    refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight. Sprinkle with paprika just before serving.
