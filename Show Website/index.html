                    <p class="p2">
                        April Roberta Ludgate-Dwyer, née Ludgate,[1] (portrayed by Aubrey Plaza) is a fictional
                        character in the NBC comedy Parks and Recreation.[2] She is first seen as an apathetic college
                        student working as an intern in the Pawnee Department of Parks and Recreation, before being
                        hired as Ron Swanson's assistant. She later becomes the Deputy Director of Animal Control.
                        April, along with Plaza's performance, garnered universal acclaim and has gained popularity for
                        her goth-like behavior and deadpan-style comedy.

                    <p class="p3">
                        Ronald Ulysses Swanson is a fictional character portrayed by Nick Offerman from the situation
                        comedy television series Parks and Recreation on NBC, created by Greg Daniels and Michael Schur.
                        In the series, Ron is the director of the Parks and Recreation department of fictional town of
                        Pawnee, Indiana, and the immediate superior of series protagonist Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler). In
                        demeanor, political philosophy and work ethic, Knope and Swanson are polar opposites: where
                        Knope is sunny and outgoing, decidedly liberal and constantly working, Swanson is distant, and
                        as a staunch libertarian, is a strong advocate for small government—stating his belief that
                        government should be privatized—and therefore believes that the parks department should not even
                        exist.

                        portrayed by Chris Pratt. Originally meant to be a temporary character, Andy was so likable that

                        (Rashida Jones) unemployed, slacker boyfriend, then takes a job as a shoe-shiner at Pawnee City
