            I am a big fan of history, I started a colection my Freshman year (of WW1 stuff) and it has since grown. I
            am also good at math and similar academics. I love to play videogames and boardgames in my free time. And I
            recently joined the XC Ski team but I also love to downhill.

            My plan/goal was to (after high school) go into civil engineering in college and for a career. I also want
            to become a varsity XC skier. And I would love to complete my WW1 uniform as well as expand to other
            countries uniforms.
