        <p>
            Veterans Day (originally known as Armistice Day) is a federal holiday in the United States observed annually
            on November 11, for honoring military veterans of the United States Armed Forces.[b][1][2] It coincides with
            holidays in several countries, including Armistice Day and Remembrance Day, which also occur on the
            anniversary of the end of World War I.[3] Major hostilities of World War I were formally ended at the 11th
            hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 when the Armistice with Germany went into effect. At the
            urging of major U.S. veteran organizations, Armistice Day was renamed Veterans Day in 1954.
        </p>
        <p>
            [4] Veterans Day is distinct from Memorial Day, a U.S. public holiday in May: Veterans Day commemorates the
            service of all U.S. veterans, while the older Memorial Day, which grew out of Civil War commemorations,
            specifically honors those who have died while in military service.[5] Another military holiday that also
            occurs in May, Armed Forces Day, honors those currently serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, Women
            Veterans Day is recognized by a growing number of U.S. states that specifically honor women who have served
            in the U.S. military.

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
            On November 11, 1919, President Woodrow Wilson issued a message to his countrymen on the first Armistice
            Day, in which he expressed what he felt the day meant to Americans:
        </p>

        <p>
            A year ago today our enemies laid down their arms in accordance with an armistice which rendered them
            impotent to renew hostilities, and gave to the world an assured opportunity to reconstruct its shattered
            order and to work out in peace a new and more just set of international relations. The soldiers and people
            of the European Allies had fought and endured for more than four years to uphold the barrier of civilization
            against the aggressions of armed force. We ourselves had been in the conflict something more than a year and
            a half.
        </p>

        <p>
            With splendid forgetfulness of mere personal concerns, we remodeled our industries, concentrated our
            financial resources, increased our agricultural output, and assembled a great army, so that at the last our
            power was a decisive factor in the victory. We were able to bring the vast resources, material and moral, of
            a great and free people to the assistance of our associates in Europe who had suffered and sacrificed
            without limit in the cause for which we fought.
        </p>

        <p>
            Out of this victory there arose new possibilities of political freedom and economic concert. The war showed
            us the strength of great nations acting together for high purposes, and the victory of arms foretells the
            enduring conquests which can be made in peace when nations act justly and in furtherance of the common
            interests of men.
        </p>
        <p>
            To us in America the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those
            who died in the country's service, and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which
            it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and
            justice in the councils of nations.[6]
        </p>
        <p>
            The United States Congress adopted a resolution on June 4, 1926, requesting that President Calvin Coolidge
            issue annual proclamations calling for the observance of November 11 with appropriate ceremonies.[6] A
            Congressional Act (52 Stat. 351; 5 U.S. Code, Sec. 87a) approved May 13, 1938, made November 11 in each year
            a legal holiday: "a day to be dedicated to the cause of world peace and to be thereafter celebrated and
            known as 'Armistice Day'".[4]
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1945, World War II veteran Raymond Weeks from Birmingham, Alabama, had the idea of a national holiday
            that would honor all war veterans, living and dead, to be celebrated on Armistice Day. Weeks led a
            delegation to Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, who supported the idea of National Veterans Day. Weeks led the first
            national celebration in 1947 in Alabama and annually until his death in 1985. President Reagan honored Weeks
            at the White House with the Presidential Citizenship Medal in 1982 as the driving force for the national
            holiday. Elizabeth Dole, who prepared the briefing for President Reagan, determined Weeks as the "Father of
            Veterans Day".[7]
        </p>
        <p>
            US Representative Ed Rees from Emporia, Kansas, presented a bill establishing the holiday through Congress.
            President Dwight D. Eisenhower, also from Kansas, signed the bill into law on May 26, 1954. It had been
            eight and a half years since Weeks held his first Armistice Day celebration for all veterans.[8]
        </p>
        <p>
            Congress amended the bill on June 1, 1954, replacing "Armistice" with "Veterans," and it has been known as
            Veterans Day since.[4][9]
        </p>
        <p>
            The National Veterans Award was also created in 1954. Congressman Rees of Kansas received the first National
            Veterans Award in Birmingham, Alabama, for his support in offering legislation to make Veterans Day a
            federal holiday.[10]
        </p>
        <p>
            Although originally scheduled for celebration on November 11 of every year, starting in 1971 in accordance
            with the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, Veterans Day was moved to the fourth Monday of October (October 25,
            1971;[11] October 23, 1972; October 22, 1973; October 28, 1974; October 27, 1975; October 25, 1976, and
            October 24, 1977). In 1978, it was moved back to its original celebration on November 11. While the legal
            holiday remains on November 11, if that date happens to be on a Saturday or Sunday, then federal government
            employees and a number of organizations will instead take the day off on the adjacent Friday or Monday,
            respectively.[12]
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Observance</h3>
        <p>
            Because it is a federal holiday, some American workers and many students have Veterans Day off from work or
            school. When Veterans Day falls on a Saturday then either Saturday or the preceding Friday may be designated
            as the holiday, whereas if it falls on a Sunday it is typically observed on the following Monday. When it
            falls on the weekend many private companies offer it as a floating holiday where employees can choose some
            other day.[citation needed] A Society for Human Resource Management poll in 2010 found that 21 percent of
            employers planned to observe the holiday in 2011.[13]
        </p>
        <p>Legally, two minutes of silence is recommended to be observed at 2:11pm Eastern Standard Time.[14]</p>
        <p>
            Non-essential federal government offices are closed. No mail is delivered. All federal workers are paid for
            the holiday; those who are required to work on the holiday sometimes receive holiday pay for that day in
            addition to their wages.[15]
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h4>Armistace Day</h4>
        <p>
            In his Armistice Day address to Congress, Wilson was sensitive to the psychological toll of the lean War
            years: "Hunger does not breed reform; it breeds madness," he remarked.[16] As Veterans Day and the birthday
            of the United States Marine Corps (November 10, 1775) are only one day apart, that branch of the Armed
            Forces customarily observes both occasions as a 96-hour liberty period.[citation needed]
        </p>
        <p>
            Election Day is a regular working day, while Veterans Day, which typically falls the following week, is a
            federal holiday. The National Commission on Federal Election Reform called for the holidays to be merged, so
            citizens can have a day off to vote. They state this as a way to honor voting by exercising democratic
            rights.[17]
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h4>Spelling of Veterans Day</h4>
        <p>
            While the holiday is commonly printed as Veteran's Day or Veterans' Day in calendars and advertisements, the
            United States Department of Veterans Affairs website states that the attributive (no apostrophe) rather than
            the possessive case is the official spelling "because it is not a day that 'belongs' to veterans, it is a
            day for honoring all veterans."[3]
