            <h3>How to make:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li class="bod">
                    Place the ground meats, both bread crumbs, parsley, Parmesan, salt, pepper, nutmeg, egg, and 3/4 cup
                    warm water in a bowl. Combine very lightly with a fork. Using your hands, lightly form the mixture
                    into 2-inch meatballs. You will have 14 to 16 meatballs.
                </li>
                <li class="bod">
                    Pour equal amounts of vegetable oil and olive oil into a large (12-inch) skillet to a depth of
                    1/4-inch. Heat the oil. Very carefully, in batches, place the meatballs in the oil and brown them
                    well on all sides over medium-low heat, turning carefully with a spatula or a fork. This should take
                    about 10 minutes for each batch. Don't crowd the meatballs. Remove the meatballs to a plate covered
                    with paper towels. Discard the oil but don't clean the pan.
                </li>
                <li class="bod">
                    For the sauce, heat the olive oil in the same pan. Add the onion and saute over medium heat until
                    translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute. Add the wine and cook on
                    high heat, scraping up all the brown bits in the pan, until almost all the liquid evaporates, about
                    3 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, parsley, salt, and pepper.
                </li>
                <li class="bod">
                    Return the meatballs to the sauce, cover, and simmer on the lowest heat for 25 to 30 minutes, until
                    the meatballs are cooked through. Serve hot on cooked spaghetti and pass the grated Parmesan.
