                    Influence: Otto von Bismarck is most famous for his role in German unification. He became a hero to
                    German nationalists, who built monuments honouring him. While praised[by whom?] as a visionary who
                    kept the peace in Europe through diplomacy, he is criticised for his persecution of Poles and
                    Catholics as well as the immense power centralised within his office as Chancellor. He is also
                    criticised by opponents of German nationalism, as it became engrained in German culture, galvanising
                    the country to aggressively pursue nationalistic policies in both World Wars.

                <div class="conpt">
                    <p class="t">Date of Birth: 27th October 1858</p>

                    Influence: Historians credit Roosevelt for changing the nation's political system by placing the
                    "bully pulpit" of the presidency at center stage and emphasizing character as much as issues. His
                    accomplishments include trust busting and conservationism. He is a hero to liberals and progressives
                    for his early proposals that foreshadowed the modern welfare state, including federal taxation,
                    labor reforms, and more direct democracy. Conservationists admire Roosevelt for prioritizing the
                    environment and selflessness towards future generations. Conservatives and nationalists respect his
                    commitment to law and order, civic duty, and military values. Dalton states, "Today he is heralded
                    as the architect of the modern presidency, as a world leader who boldly reshaped the office to meet
                    the needs of the new century."

                <div class="conpl">
                    <p class="l">Date of Birth: 22nd April 1870</p>

                    Influence: Lenin was the posthumous subject of a pervasive personality cult within the Soviet Union
                    until its dissolution in 1991. Under Stalin, he became an ideological figurehead of Marxismâ€“Leninism
                    and a prominent influence over the international communist movement. A controversial and highly
                    divisive figure, Lenin is praised by his supporters for establishing a revolutionary government
                    which took steps towards socialism, while his critics accuse him of establishing a dictatorship
                    which oversaw mass killings and political repression against the anti-revolution forces. Today, he
                    is widely considered one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century.
